# Whitelabel Banking App

To run the app, first you'll need to install node dependencies and then kick off the `Vite` serve. Run the following commands to do so:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

You can also run client specific builds. For example, `npm run dev-chase` will run a development build for `Chase` and serve it.
